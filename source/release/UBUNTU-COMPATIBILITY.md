## Boost compatibility update — 2026-10-30

Four timer cancellation calls in probe, crawler and transport now use the
supported zero-argument cancel() API with system_error handling during cleanup.
Socket cancellation calls are unchanged. This addresses the Boost 1.90 build failure.

Operator-provided Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS results (GCC 15.2.0 / Boost 1.90.0):
- Release CTest: 50/50 passed, 1.94 seconds.
- Federation/handshake repeated regression checks: passed, 24.56 seconds.
- Application smoke and full release gate: PASS.
- ASan/UBSan CTest: 50/50 passed, 13.14 seconds; full sanitizer gate: PASS.
- Nonfatal shared_ptr atomic deprecation and federation indentation warnings remain.

Earlier Ubuntu 22.04/GCC11 results cover the preceding runtime revision.
The timer-adjusted revision has not been retested on Ubuntu 22.04 here.
Ubuntu 24.04 full-suite validation remains pending.
Reboot recovery: NOT TESTED. Live Tor/I2P connections: NOT TESTED.
Transport component/mock tests do not establish live overlay connectivity.

Tests were run by the operator, not the packaging agent. The logs report version
1.0.0. The operator supplied no source/binary hash, so these are evidence for the
described changes, not a cryptographic attestation of this archive. Packaging
checks verify archive integrity; no new C++ build or deployment ran locally.
